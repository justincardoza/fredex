These are my solutions for the Gild FredEx Shipping challenge. I tried 
several languages, getting a maximum score of 83 with my best Ruby solution 
(which was kind of ugly, but only 109 bytes in the end). I discovered some 
interesting things while writing my solutions, not least of which is how 
cool of a language Ruby is. I'll definitely be teaching myself more Ruby in 
the near future. It looks like quite a powerful and expressive language.

Congratulations to Dusan Zelembaba for winning this challenge!
